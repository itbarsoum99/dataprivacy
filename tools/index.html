      <h2>Privacy alternatives to an invasive web</h2>
      <p>At present, companies like Facebook, Google, and Apple consistently invade the privacy of oblivious consumers. Luckily, there are pro-privacy alternatives to many of the services that these companies provide.</p>
      <h3>Web Browser: Brave</h3>
      <p>Brave Web Browser is based on Chromium (like Google Chrome) but instead of invading privacy, it actively shields you from invasions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://brave.com/">Download Brave</a></p>
      <h3>Search Engine: DuckDuckGo</h3>
      <p>DuckDuckGo is the partner of Brave, and it provides quality search results without invasion of privacy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Visit DuckDuckGo</a></p>
      <h3>Email Client: ProtonMail</h3>
      <p>ProtonMail provides privacy-focused encrypted email without independent contractors reading your private messages.</p>
      <p><a href="https://protonmail.com/">Sign up for ProtonMail</a></p>
      <h3>Smartphone: Blackphone 2</h3>
      <p>The Blackphone 2 runs on Google's Android operating system but has a more secure operating system on top of it, which enhances privacy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Circle-Blackphone-Smartphone-Subscription/dp/B06XD4RDFF">Purchase the Blackphone 2</a></p>
      <h3>Smart Speaker: Mycroft AI Mark II</h3>
      <p>The Mycroft AI Smart Speaker is a privacy-focused speaker that gives the best results, not the ones they were paid to give.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mycroft.ai/get-started/">Get started with Mycroft AI</a></p>
      <h3>Social Media: None</h3>
      <p>There is no viable option for social media use without being exposed to trackers and targeted advertising. Privacy, though improved if you're using these services through Brave, is virtually impossible to achieve while using social networks.</p>
      <h3>Operating System: OpenSUSE</h3>
      <p>OpenSUSE, a Linux operating system, is one of few operating systems left that's entirely open source, free, and has no advertisements on the desktop.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">Download OpenSUSE</a></p>
      <h3>Document Editor: ONLYOFFICE</h3>
      <p>ONLYOFFICE offers an alternative to Microsoft Word and Google Docs without privacy invasions using trackers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://personal.onlyoffice.com/">Visit ONLYOFFICE</a></p>
      <h3>Mapping: OpenStreetMap</h3>
      <p>OpenStreetMap is a collaborative effort to create a free map of the world and has the highest privacy standards of the mainstream mapping services.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">Visit OpenStreetMap</a></p>
      <h3>Video Conferencing: Jitsi Meet</h3>
      <p>Jitsi is an open-source video conferencing application that is fully encrypted, allowing for more security than mainstream application like Zoom and Microsoft Teams.</p>
      <p><a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/">Download Jitsi Meet</a></p>
