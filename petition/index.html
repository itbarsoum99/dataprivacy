      <h2>How to take action with the Project for a Private Web</h2>
      <p>The Project for a Private Web utilizes the constitutional right to petition in order to press lawmakers toward enacting stronger regulations against entities that abuse their power to collect and misuse user data on the internet. You can help by petitioning the Senators from your state and the Representative from your Congressional District to enact the resolution written below, which is an adaptation of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/583/text">DATA Privacy Act</a> introduced by Sen. Cortez Masto in the 116th United States Congress.</p>
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>Who are my representatives?</h3>
      <p>Politiwatch, a privacy-respecting digital rights advocate organization, has a tool to find your representatives as well as their contact information: <a href="https://whoaremyrepresentatives.org/">whoaremyrepresentatives.org</a>.</p>
      <h3>How can I contact them?</h3>
      <p>You can call them, send them a letter, or email them. No matter how you ask them to enact stronger regulations, you have helped strengthen internet privacy.</p>
      <h3>Is my petition going to make a real difference?</h3>
      <p>Your petition matters. If lawmakers are petitioned many times about the same issue, they are more likely to take action. Your petition helps apply pressure to convince them to support this action.</p>
      <h3>What will the Act supported by the Project for a Private Web do if enacted?</h3>
      <p>This Act will impose limitations on the methods of data collection on the internet, as well as limits on the usage of that data for purposes like targeted advertising. You can read the full act below.</p>
      <h3>How do I petition?</h3>
      <p>Just say what you believe. If you have trouble coming up with ideas for your petition, there's a prewritten one below that we suggest using. It will be better if it's personal, though.</p>
