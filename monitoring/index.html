      <h2>How Internet giants track users across websites, browsers, and platforms</h2>
      <p>It was March 2018 when the <i>New York Times</i> first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html">reported</a> that a private voter-profiling firm called Cambridge Analytica had harvested supposedly private information from the Facebook profiles of over fifty million users without their permission or knowledge. The firm intended  to sell the data of American voters and Facebook users to Republican 2016 presidential campaigns, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cambridge-analytica-facebook-scandal-trump-cruz-operatives-2018-3">namely</a> the ones of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. The firm acquired these users' <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/30/facebook-failed-to-protect-30-million-users-from-having-their-data-harvested-by-trump-campaign-affiliate/">demographic data and history of "likes."</a> Without the misuse of data collection mechanisms on their website, Facebook wouldn't have had this data in the first place.</p>
      <p>The fact remains that these users still chose to give that data to Facebook. What's more disturbing is that their misuse of user data goes beyond selling it to private data firms that seek to boost a particular candidate in democratic elections. In 2016, the <i>Washington Post</i> compiled a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/08/19/98-personal-data-points-that-facebook-uses-to-target-ads-to-you/">list</a> of 98 data points that Facebook uses to show its users targeted advertising content. They use the data points, which the <i>Post</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/08/19/98-personal-data-points-that-facebook-uses-to-target-ads-to-you/">reports</a> include location, generation, education level, ethnic affinity, property size, and relationship status (which are not all directly provided to the company by the user) to target the user with advertisements.</p> 
      <p>The <i>Post</i> put it this way:</p>
      <blockquote><p>When combined with the information you’ve already given Facebook, you end up with what is arguably the most complete consumer profile on earth: a snapshot not only of your Facebook activity, but your behaviors elsewhere in the online (and offline!) worlds.</p></blockquote>
      <p>Afterwards, the company doing the advertising sees an increase in sales thanks to their advertising investment, which prompts them to pay Facebook for more ad space. Thus, by exploiting user data, Facebook makes a profit: in 2017, they made <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/11/17177842/facebook-advertising-ads-explained-mark-zuckerberg">$40 billion</a> in advertising revenue.</p>
      <p>Because they're able to make a profit off of their users, Facebook is then able to use that money to grow - into a monopoly, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit/">United States alleges</a>. Once their social network became prominent enough to gain more users and to garner constant advertising from reliable groups and corporations, it became a constant machine of exponential financial growth.</p> 
      <p>Thanks to its prevalence, Facebook is able to collect and sell user data for profit. However, not only users are affected by their poor data practices. A product management director revealed that <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/heres-how-facebook-collects-your-data-when-youre-logged-out/">any site with Facebook social plugins</a> ("like" or "share" buttons embedded) is also collecting data for the social network, even when users are not logged in to the service - and from individuals who don't have an account in the first place. In other words, any website visited by an individual that contains a Facebook social plugin will collect data on that individual that is then acquired by Facebook - even if the individual has never created an account with them.</p>
      <p>It's not only Facebook that collects and misuses user data. Google does, too. Its <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/google-collects-a-frightening-amount-of-data-about-you-you-can-find-and-delete-it-now/">"frightening"</a> data collection practices include recording every search a user performs and every YouTube video an individual views.</p>
      <p>If an individual has Google Maps on their smartphone, it logs everywhere that individual goes and how long they stay there - even if the user never opens the app, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/google-collects-a-frightening-amount-of-data-about-you-you-can-find-and-delete-it-now/">CNET reports</a>. Google themselves admitted that they scan user messages in Gmail to create a list of the user's online purchases. Like Facebook, Google does not need an individual to be signed in to track them.</p>
      <p>If someone has Google Home or Nest in their house, the voice assistant, always listening, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/is-your-google-home-or-nest-secure-how-to-find-and-delete-your-private-data/">regularly records audio</a> and sends it to Google. On the receiving end, it's not just computers listening to private life - it's <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/amazon-and-google-are-listening-to-your-voice-recordings-heres-what-we-know/">people, too</a>. Google hired contractors to listen to user audio clips with the intention of "improving their respective assistant's capabilities." However, the question remains as to whether or not the data is actually private - and if it's not, who else has access to it?</p>
      <p>On top of that, any website that uses Google Analytics to track its users - over <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics">seventy percent</a> of the top 10,000 sites by traffic do - is sending some data about the user back to Google, without that user's knowledge or consent. The incentive for that website's developers to use the tool provided by Google is that they get to see all of the information collected, too.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://tribulant.com/files/productimages/shot_1398345779.png">Google Analytics dashboard</a> gives developers a snapshot of their website's usage - including the number of visits and the average time spent on the site, as well as more detailed information about individual visitors - which allows them to improve their website experience and specifically target the type of users their website attracts.</p>
      <p>The poor data practices by internet giants aren't just limited to Facebook and Google, of course. Amazon, like Google, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/amazon-and-google-are-listening-to-your-voice-recordings-heres-what-we-know/">admitted</a> to hiring contractors to listen to audio recordings from their Alexa smart speaker. Twitter <a href="https://useguard.com/products/twitter">reserves the right</a> to sell user information to advertisers, companies, and governments. Apple's phones come with <a href="https://gizmodo.com/apples-ad-practices-are-the-latest-target-for-privacy-a-1845691038">built-in advertising tracker IDs</a> that allow mobile app developers to track the user within their app.</p>
      <p>This is just the tip of the iceberg in how poor privacy practices allow companies to know more about the user than they should - possibly even more about the user than their friends and family know. That user is completely exposed to massive global corporations with a disregard for data privacy. That user is unable to do anything about it. That user is you.</p>
