      <h2>How Internet giants collect and misuse data for profit</h2>
      <p>In 2016, the <i>Washington Post</i> compiled a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/08/19/98-personal-data-points-that-facebook-uses-to-target-ads-to-you/">list</a> of 98 data points that Facebook uses to show its users targeted advertising content. They use the data points, which the <i>Post</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/08/19/98-personal-data-points-that-facebook-uses-to-target-ads-to-you/">reports</a> include location, generation, education level, ethnic affinity, property size, and relationship status (which are not all directly provided to the company by the user) to target the user with advertisements.</p> 
      <p>The <i>Post</i> put it this way:</p>
      <blockquote><p>When combined with the information you’ve already given Facebook, you end up with what is arguably the most complete consumer profile on earth: a snapshot not only of your Facebook activity, but your behaviors elsewhere in the online (and offline!) worlds.</p></blockquote>
      <p>Afterwards, the company doing the advertising sees an increase in sales thanks to their advertising investment, which prompts them to pay Facebook for more ad space. Thus, by exploiting user data, Facebook makes a profit: in 2017, they made <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/11/17177842/facebook-advertising-ads-explained-mark-zuckerberg">$40 billion</a> in advertising revenue.</p>
      <p>Because they're able to make a profit off of their users, Facebook is then able to use that money to grow - into a monopoly, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit/">United States alleges</a>. Once their social network became prominent enough to gain more users and to garner constant advertising from reliable groups and corporations, it became a constant machine of exponential financial growth.</p> 
      <p>How exactly does Facebook target these ads toward the user? CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-do-facebook-ads-target-you/">reported</a> three primary ways that advertisers can customize the targeting of their Facebook ads:</p>
      <blockquote>Trying to pitch your boutique bed and breakfast to a 44-year-old "trendy mom" who lives in Seattle, leans conservative and is currently traveling in the Toronto area but hasn't booked a hotel for the night yet? Go right ahead. Interested in mail-ordering pet treats to a 32-year-old cat owner in Madison, Wisconsin who enjoys Japanese food, doesn't like pizza and has an anniversary coming up in the next two months? Not a problem. <br /> If you want to tailor a Facebook ad to a single user out of its universe of 2.2 billion, you could.</blockquote>
      <p>The primary way that advertisers can utilize in order to target users on Facebook is by monitoring their activity on the social network. Facebook's massive data collection operation ranges from geographic information to "ethnic affinity." This can be a problem in some cases: in 2016, ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters">found</a> that Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude specific ethnic groups from seeing housing ads; this is illegal. ProPublica's report also <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters">said</a> that Facebook's data practices enabled advertisers to reach 'Jew haters.'</p>
      <p>A second way that advertisers can target users is by digitally following them outside of Facebook itself. This means, for example, that advertisers can target anyone who has made purchases from them, has visited their website, has shared an email address, or has downloaded their app. Furthermore, audiences that are similar to the existing customer base can also be used as a target from Facebook's algorithms.</p>
      <p>The final method that advertise can use is through Facebook's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/dynamic-ads">dynamic ads</a>, which shows a user the most relevant of the company's ads to their interests without the advertiser having to select a target audience:</p>
      <blockquote>Dynamic ads let Holiday Inn target people who searched for hotels on its website but hadn't yet booked. The ads these Facebook users saw had a video personalized to the dates and places they searched for. The result: the hotel chain got three times the return on what it spent on these ads than on their previous ad campaigns.</blockquote>
      <p>Facebook describes this technology as creating the ability to "show people products that are tailored to their interests, whether or not they’ve been to your site or app." This requires less direct management by the advertiser and simply allows the Facebook algorithms to target a user itself.</p>
      <p>On top of giving Facebook a clear picture of a user's personal information, the network's tracking tools also allow advertisers to have a picture of that user's personal information as well - and to make a profit off of the information. Selling targeted ads creates an endless positive feedback loop for Facebook: they are paid to place ads on their site that specifically target users; those users click on the ads and make purchases, which provides validation to the advertiser that the ad purchase worked and creates a profit; and the advertiser invests further in Facebook ads, which creates an exponential growth in profit for the social network.</p>
      <p>Facebook has plenty of incentive to track the user. What's stoping them from going further? Nothing, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apps/2019/11/12/facebook-camera-ios-iphone/">according to Joshua Maddux</a>, a web strategist. Maddux alleges that Facebook actively uses an individual's phone camera when the app is open. A mass communication professor at the University of South Florida <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-using-people-s-phones-listen-what-they-re-saying-claims-professor-a7057526.html">warned</a> that Facebook, which listens to its surroundings for the claimed purpose of "seeing what people are listening to or watching and suggesting that they post about it." However, the professor says that Facebook appears to be using the audio it gathers to listen into individuals' discussions and target them with relevant advertising.</p>
      <p>Facebook is willing to go so far in attempting to create effective targeted advertising that it will listen to conversations and watch individuals through their cameras to improve their digitally assembled picture of the user. For profit, they'll do anything. Do you want to be the user exploited for profit?</p>
