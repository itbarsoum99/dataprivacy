      <h2>How Internet giants' misuse of data leads to the spread of misinformation</h2>
      <p>The impacts of the ad targeting described in <a href="/monetization/">Essay 02: Monetization</a> go far beyond what many users realize. Targeted political advertising has massive implications for society as a whole.</p>
      <p>First, companies like Facebook and Google allow anyone to buy advertising - and use whatever ad they would like in the spot they've purchased. There are no limits or regulations on how factual these advertisements can be. This can lead to fearmongering and reality warping: by allowing politicians, their campaigns, and their surrogates to spread false information online, which can then be replicated by their followers and spread at a lightning-fast rate, the companies that enable targeted political advertising open the door for reality warping.</p>
      <p>Thus, these companies have created "echo chambers" and "filter bubbles," according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/online-ad-targeting-political-misinformation-3fac586c-2412-4c2b-a9c9-cbd2d47de6f8.html">Axios</a>, that segment reality itself based on a person's ideology. In a pre-targeted advertising world, opponents of politicians who spread misinformation could easily counter or call out the misinformant. However, with the use of specifically targeted advertising, it has become nearly impossible for the opponents of the misinformant to call out such behavior.</p>
      <p>Yael Elsenstat, a former elections integrity head at Facebook, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/11/04/i-worked-political-ads-facebook-they-profit-by-manipulating-us/">opined in the <i>Washington Post</i></a>:
      <blockquote>Facebook profits partly by amplifying lies and selling dangerous targeting tools that allow political operatives to engage in a new level of information warfare. Its business model exploits our data to let advertisers aim at us, showing each of us a different version of the truth and manipulating us with hyper-customized ads...as long as Facebook prioritizes profit over healthy discourse, it can't avoid damaging democracy.</blockquote>
      <p>The problem goes beyond targeted political advertising. Arwa Mahdawi <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/targeted-ads-fake-news-clickbait-surveillance-capitalism-data-mining-democracy">wrote in the <i>Guardian</i></a> that targeted advertising has led to proliferation of fake news, has fueled surveillance capitalism and has normalized tracking and data-mining. Bob Sullivan, an author and investigative journalist, <a href="https://bobsullivan.net/syndication/hate-and-misinformation-are-a-feature-not-a-bug-ban-targeted-ads-movement-gains-traction/">wrote this</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Google, Facebook, and Twitter make money through user engagement, and have cracked the code on keeping users glued to their services: outrage.  By tracking user habits and hacking into their primal instincts, consumers are dragged into ratholes that lead to widespread spreading of misinformation hate speech.  Like-minded — or at least like-behaving — groups are then sold to advertisers.  This is a profitable enterprise — [Matt] Stoller pointed out that YouTube recommended conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ videos 15 billion times.</blockquote>
      <p>In the 2020 United States presidential election, President Donald J. Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/08/trump-facebook-ads-target-latinos-anti-immigrant">launched Facebook advertisements</a> that specifically targeted Latinx voters in Texas. In Florida, one of the few states where the president made gains statewide compared to 2016, he <a href="https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2020/11/13/trump-won-florida-after-running-a-false-ad-in-spanish-linking-biden-to-venezuelan-socialists">ran an ad campaign</a> on YouTube claiming that Nicolás Maduro and the ruling party in Venezuela was backing President-elect Joe Biden. He also sought to tie Biden to the former Cuban President Fidel Castro; in the election, he carried 55% of the Cuban-American vote.</p>
      <p>Google collects data from searches performed on a specific Google account, and they <a href="https://www.webpresencesolutions.net/7-reasons-google-search-results-vary-dramatically/">use this information</a> to show different results based on past behavior. For example, if you go to Google's search and type in "climate change is," you will see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvg0eY_Ls4Y">different results</a> based on what Google knows about your interests.</p>
      <blockquote>If everyone is entitled to their own facts, there's really no need for people to come together. In fact, there's really no need for people to interact.</blockquote>
      <p>Targeted advertising fundamentally alters the way we see the world. It exacerbates polarization, causes violence, and damages democracy. By giving everyone their own reality, there is no need to come together to solve existential problems: in some circles, climate change is a hoax; in others, so is the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
      <p>By allowing ad targeting to promote misinformation, as well as promoting posts and search results that align with a user's personal beliefs, entities like Facebook and Google encourage individuals to live in their own realities, believing different fundamental facts. If we can't even agree on the facts, how will humanity survive?</p>
